# Sustainable Infrastructure Development Project

## Overview

This project is designed to leverage satellite imagery and machine learning to support sustainable infrastructure development and environmental conservation. The project involves classifying land cover and assessing the suitability of various regions for infrastructure projects, with a strong emphasis on sustainability. The project integrates modern MLOps practices to ensure robust deployment and monitoring.

## Features

- **Land Cover Classification**: Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models to classify satellite images into different land cover categories.
- **Infrastructure Suitability Analysis**: Evaluates the suitability of land for various types of infrastructure development, factoring in environmental considerations.
- **Sustainability and Conservation**: Incorporates environmental factors to ensure infrastructure projects align with conservation goals.
- **MLOps Integration**: Employs CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and monitoring to deploy and maintain the models effectively.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sustainable-infrastructure-development.git
    cd sustainable-infrastructure-development
    ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up the data pipeline**:
    - Run data ingestion script to download the datasets:
      ```bash
      python data_pipeline/data_ingestion.py
      ```
    - Preprocess the downloaded data:
      ```bash
      python data_pipeline/data_preprocessing.py
      ```

4. **Train the models**:
    - Train the land cover classification model:
      ```bash
      python models/land_cover_model.py
      ```
    - (Optional) Train the infrastructure suitability model:
      ```bash
      python models/infrastructure_model.py
      ```

5. **Build and deploy with Docker**:
    - Build and run the Docker container:
      ```bash
      docker-compose up --build
      ```

## Usage

### API Endpoints

The FastAPI service provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /predict/`: Upload a satellite image to get a land cover classification prediction.

### Accessing the API

Once the Docker container is running, you can interact with the API using tools like `curl` or Postman. For example:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict/" -F "file=@/path/to/your/image.jpg"
```

### Monitoring

- **Prometheus**: Access it at `http://localhost:9090`.
- **Grafana**: Access it at `http://localhost:3000` (default login: `admin` / `admin`).
